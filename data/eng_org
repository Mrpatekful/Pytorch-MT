it has been just a week since i arrived in new york .
in addition to a thick fog , there was a heavy swell .
if you were more ambitious , you could go a long way .
if you really don't want to come , you don't have to .
if you could go back in time , what would you change ?
if you can't stand the heat , get out of the kitchen .
if you can't come , please let me know ahead of time .
if i were in good health , i could pursue my studies .
if i eat too much chocolate , i break out in pimples .
i'm very tired . i don't feel like taking a walk now .
i'm not saying this to hurt you , but it's the truth .
i'm looking for an easy - to - read manga with furigana .
i'm going to have to ask you to put your phone away .
i would really like to know why he did such a thing .
i would rather stay at home than go out in the rain .
i would just like to thank all of you for your work .
i wish you were wrong , but i know that you're right .
i was caught in a shower on my way home from school .
i waited for tom for three hours , but he never came .
i thought it would be a good concert , but it wasn't .
i think it's time for me to say what i really think .
i think it's time for me to get a new email address .
i think i might join you , but i haven't decided yet .
i only wish i had a little more time to finish this .
i know you probably want to be alone , so i'll leave .
i just want to make sure we're all on the same page .
i have read sixty pages , while he has read only ten .
i gave him a warning , to which he paid no attention .
i don't speak french , but i can understand it a bit .
i don't care what you say . it's not going to happen !
i avoid crossing the street here if i am in a hurry .
i answered your questions . now let me ask you a few .
i am in the habit of taking a shower in the morning .
i am going to introduce you to the rest of the crew .
how do you know that you can't do it unless you try ?
he was aware of my presence but he did not greet me .
he sent me a letter saying that he could not see me .
he is said to have been very poor when he was young .
he is a gentleman . he cannot have said such a thing .
he can't do this kind of work , and she can't either .
don't you think it odd that she was in such a hurry ?
be quiet . if you aren't quiet , you'll be thrown out .
as soon as she heard the news , she burst into tears .
as of tomorrow , this e - mail address will be invalid .
are you sure you want to put your life in her hands ?
all of a sudden , three dogs appeared in front of us .
after we walked for a while , we arrived at the lake .
a man who wanted to see you came while you were out .
you never listen . i might as well talk to the wall .
you can also ride on an old , restored , steam train .
would you like to get something to eat ? it's on me .
whether rains or not , the game is going to be held .
whenever i try to get near her , she pushes me away .
we've finished the work , so we may as well go home .
to the best of my knowledge , the rumor is not true .
this is the house where i lived when i was a child .
the root of a flower is as weak as a baby's finger .
the job looked quite simple , but it took me a week .
that , of course , does not mean that they are right .
that old man is , so to speak , a walking dictionary .
she wrote him a long letter , but he didn't read it .
she took off her old shoes and put on the new ones .
she agreed with him on what to do with the old car .
no one is so poor that he cannot afford to be neat .
no matter what you may say , i won't change my mind .
no matter how long it takes , i will finish the job .
no matter how he tried , he could not open the door .
never in my life have i heard or seen such a thing .
like all dogs , he'll chase a rabbit if he sees one .
it's bad weather , to be sure , but we've seen worse .
it would mean a great deal to me if you would stay .
it was too muggy for me to get to sleep last night .
it was such a pleasant day that we went for a walk .
it was careless of you to leave the key in the car .
it is so dreadful that i don't want to think of it .
it is said that he is the richest man in the world .
it appears to me that you put on my hat by mistake .
if no one has a better proposal , let's get to work .
if he told me the truth , i would have forgiven him .
if he had failed the exam , what would he have done ?
if i tell him the truth , she will never forgive me .
if i tell her the truth , she will never forgive me .
if i create an example , will you correct it for me ?
i've made up my mind to learn how to play the harp .

trying to do such a thing is a waste of time .
we are going to his house . want to come with ?
we will be able to raise cows and sheep , too .
what do you say to taking a walk in the park ?
without his glasses , he is as blind as a bat .
would you be so kind as to lend me your book ?
you could do this if you put your mind to it .
you have to pay 10 , 000 yen extra on holidays .
am i the only one that sees the humor in this ?
are you sure you don't want me to go with you ?
as a matter of fact , i know nothing about him .
as far as i am concerned , i have no objection .
at the start , i was really still a bit scared .
be sure to turn out the light when you go out .
do i look like a guy who wants to get married ?
do you think i'm too old to go back to school ?
give me the money you owe me and i'll be gone .
go and get a chair from the next room , please .
he had no money and so could not buy any food .
he is always a step or two ahead of the times .
he is not the sort of guy who gives in easily .
he took a taxi in order not to miss the train .
he was very tall , so i recognized him at once .
he will be angry to learn that she told a lie .
his son has what it takes to be a good doctor .
how much do you think i can get for my kidney ?
i always have to wear a tie because of my job .

i saw a movie for the first time in two years .
i suppose i'd do the same thing if i were you .

i want you to explain it to me in more detail .
i wanted you to see that i'm not all that bad .
i was able to find the book i was looking for .
i was very tired , so i fell asleep right away .
i will write letters to you as often as i can .
i would buy it , except that it costs too much .
i would like to call on you one of these days .
i'd like to say a few words by way of apology .
i'll be with you as soon as i finish this job .
i'm not going to stay if you don't want me to .
i'm sorry , i don't let in people i don't know .
i'm sorry , but my mother is out at the moment .
if the phone rings again , i plan to ignore it .
if you don't want me to stay here , i'll leave .
if you go near a camel , you risk being bitten .
if you want one , you'll have to find your own .
in other words , i don't like to work with him .
it could be a trap . don't let your guard down .
it's a nice day and i feel like taking a walk .
it's up to you to decide whether or not to go .
my father is going to make a trip to new york .
never did i expect to see her in such a place .

please just tell me what it is you want to do .
she came very near to being run over by a car .
she dog - eared the page and set the book aside .

to tell the truth , i don't like her very much .

we were told by him to leave the room at once .
what i really want to do is to get some sleep .

i knew they were on the list .
i knew we were going to lose .
i knew you'd come back to me .
i know i'm not a likable guy .
i know tom is in great shape .
i know how badly you want it .
i know how much you love tom .
i know how this looks to you .
i know none of the three men .
i know the man you came with .

i made you a pair of mittens .
i may have to work part time .
i meet him from time to time .
i met him in tokyo by chance .
i must buy a new winter coat .
i must make up for lost time .
i need you for just a second .
i never feed my dog raw meat .
i never laid a finger on her .
i only came to say i'm sorry .
i only hope i'm not too late .
i only know what you tell me .
i ought to do this by myself .
i ought to know , shouldn't i ?
i owe my success to her help .
i owe my success to his help .
i plan to tell tom about you .
i plan to write tom a letter .
i put some milk in my coffee .
i read about it in the paper .
i really need to talk to you .

i saw her just the other day .
i saw the boy in brown shoes .
i saw the man enter the room .
i saw you at the flower shop .
i say it's time for a change .
i see your cat in the garden .

mary is as tall as tom is .
i have an ache in my arm .

i have no idea who he is .
my wish is to be a singer .
i have no one to help me .
not a soul was to be seen .
i have no one to talk to .
not a star was to be seen .
i have to go talk to tom .
i never thought tom could do it .
i never thought i would do that .
i never spoke to him after that .
i never said that i wanted that .
i never said it would be simple .
i need that as soon as possible .
i need it for the parking meter .

i knew what was going to happen .
i knew this was going to happen .
i knew it would be an adventure .
i keep my hammer in the toolbox .

i guess that she is over thirty .
i guess i'll find out next week .
i guess i just got carried away .
i guess i could use the company .
i guess i could use some advice .
i got up very late this morning .

i get asked that question a lot .
i gave her just what she needed .
i forgot to buy a birthday cake .

lie on your right side .
let's take a tea break .
let's take a short cut .
let's take a rest here .
let's sit on the grass .
let's sit on the bench .
let's see what it does .
let's plug up the hole .
let's not be too hasty .
let's go to the picnic .
let's go ahead and eat .
let's get it over with .
let's get back to work .

let's begin on page 30 .
let's be clear on this .
let us finish our work .

let me write that down .
let me think this over .
let me see your tongue .
let me join your cause .
let me check my wallet .
keep your hands off me .
keep up with the times .
keep it secret , please .
keep away from the dog .
just tell us the truth .
just get off the stage .
just be glad you're ok .
it's your turn to sing .
it's your duty to vote .
it's too late for them .
it's too early to know .
it's time we went home .
it's time to eat lunch .
it's there to the left .
it's not just a theory .
it's not far to boston .
it's not an easy sport .
it's no trouble at all .

it's going to get ugly .
it's going to be close .
it's for you to decide .
it's close to my house .
it's been a long night .
it's bad for the heart .

it's a matter of taste .

it was never like that .
it was hard to believe .
it was chilly that day .
it was all for nothing .
it was a wise decision .
it was a weird feeling .

it was a bold decision .
it varies a great deal .
it sounds like a dream .

it might not even work .
it might not be enough .
it means nothing to me .
it may rain any minute .
it makes me feel dirty .
it looks like an apple .
it looks good on paper .
it just makes no sense .

it is to his advantage .
it is their last movie .
it is raining hard now .
it is not his business .
it is finally all over .
it happened in a flash .
it had started to rain .
it gives me the creeps .
