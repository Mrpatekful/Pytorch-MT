<SOS> <ENG> it seems obvious that he is sick . <EOS> 
<SOS> <ENG> it seems that he knows the truth . <EOS> 
<SOS> <ENG> it was obvious that he was lying . <EOS> 
<SOS> <ENG> it was the calm before the storm . <EOS> 
<SOS> <ENG> it was very dark inside the mine . <EOS>

<SOS> <ENG> it's evident that you told a lie . <EOS> 
<SOS> <ENG> it's like being in a candy store . <EOS> 
<SOS> <ENG> it's natural for you to think so . <EOS> 
<SOS> <ENG> it's not as easy as people think . <EOS> 
<SOS> <ENG> it's not clear when he came here . <EOS> 
<SOS> <ENG> it's not easy to thread a needle . <EOS> 
<SOS> <ENG> it's not quite as simple as that . <EOS> 
<SOS> <ENG> it's right in front of your eyes . <EOS> 
<SOS> <ENG> it's so good to finally meet you . <EOS> 
<SOS> <ENG> it's the rule , not the exception . <EOS>
