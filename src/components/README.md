# Components

Components are the main building blocks of the models. In particular, the sequence-to-sequence type models are the most well-suited
for these modular elements. In the current state of the API, there are two distinct versions of the components, encoders and decoders.
Each of these have 3 different methods:

1. Recurrent
2. Convolutional
3. Quasi-Recurrent
